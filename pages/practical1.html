    <h2><u>About Course</u></h2>
    <p><b>Front-end</b> web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web
    application. Typically it refers to the <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> (HTML), <b>Cascading
    Style Sheets</b>(CSS) and <b>Javascript</b> portion of website production as opposed to the
    <i>database</i> or <i>server-side programming</i>. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of
    HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different
    browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
